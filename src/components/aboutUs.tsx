            Platform designed to help students and ecturers work together more easily. 
            Students can upload videos of their exercises through a mobile app, 
            and lecturers can review these videos, give feedback, and assign grades through a web app. 
            The system ensures smooth communication and supports students with poor internet by allowing them to upload 
            videos later when they have a connection.
